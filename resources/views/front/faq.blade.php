                                        Absolutely no, these are not visual ballistics or any single number I am predicting has no effect even if they change the dealer’s number from an algorithm based on the number sequence.
                                        Is not visual ballistics see here and look at the dealer’s name after the first win. The language of what I named it “roulette syllabus" is not roulette strategy you learn and understand why you bet and why you did not win at that point. Every bet you place you well, no risk and the bankroll before you start to bet on the sequence. I train you to bet with confidence, not hoping to win your bet.

                                        <p>Playing on 2 euros minimum bet / chip would severely increase the finances needed to play our strategy (for 2.000 credits you are already talking 4.000 dollars or euros for one session).

                                        <p>This is a very difficult question because we would have to define 'consistently'. If consistently means that you will be able to win every time you play a session, I would say yes and no. Almost 99% of system venders do not know even when their systems are well-prepared and base on computer simulations.</p>
                                        <p>Yes because with roulette syllabus you will be able to see in advance 99% when you win before you place the bet. Here, if 'consistently' means that the sum of your losses and wins will balance in favors of wins, I would say yes.</p>
                                        <p>I have done it and so can you. A professional player is not always and every time a winner, but he is able to cut down his loss at the right time and is able to increase his gain without taking huge risk. Cannot express how important the last part is?</p>
                                        <p>If you take a huge risk, you will fail. Maybe you'll have some lucky moments, but in the end you will lose everything, so if you are planning to get rich overnight with a small initial bankroll, it cannot be done, I'm sorry to shatter your illusions.</p>

                                        Anyone who enters the casino with less than 2k with a min bet of 5$ or 20$ has a 78% probability of losing all the' max fortuna' roulette game. That's why because you don't know when your bet won well, you just hope to win or base on some computer simulation.

                                        That’s subjective. Everyone’s needs are different in terms of games, promotions, where they live, and the banking methods they can use and so on. The best way to find this answer is to read our reviews on the casino you want to use and see which casino fits your needs the most.

                                        Yes. Only if you can have the capital to invest. There’s way to shift the odds in your favor, which is needed to play and win long term. And you need to take part of my mentorship program if you are that serious.

                                        To the best of our knowledge betting systems aren’t illegal, so long as they’re not cheating. If you’re playing the game correctly then you can use whatever system you want, even the Martingale. Betting systems will have the same effectiveness online as they do live — none.              </div>

                                        Yes. The caveat here is that you need to play at legitimate casinos. Those casinos use random number generators to determine what number the ball lands in, and those RNGs are tested by companies to prove that the results are fair and random.
                                        In terms of trusting a casino — the best way is to use our reviews and recommendations. We only recommend casinos we play at (or would play at) ourselves. Read about our rogue casinos here.            </div>
